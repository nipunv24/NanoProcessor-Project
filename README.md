4-Bit NanoProcessor 🖥️
This repository contains the design and implementation of a simple 4-bit nanoprocessor capable of performing addition and subtraction of signed integers. 🔢➕➖ The project was developed using VHDL and tested on a BASYS3 board. The design and simulation were conducted using the Vivado Design Suite. 🎛️
